e-commerce platform âœ¨

Currently, we are running on the Shopify platform. Timelineleap is an ecommerce solution aimed at improving time management by providing users with streamlined tools such as calendars, journals, and planners.

As an experiment, our website is currently hosted on the Shopify domain. However, in the future, we plan to migrate the website to Next.js using Next.js Commerce (https://nextjs.org/commerce). We will provide the code for this migration here. Until the production is ready, the website will continue to operate on the Shopify domain.

To Do:
- Add current source code
- Add Shopify branch and Next branch for respective tech stach
